# 🧪 Trello API Testing Project

## 📌 Overview

This project shows how I tested the Trello API using Postman.

I created a simple workflow where I work with boards, lists, and cards, and I validate the responses using test scripts.

## ⚙️ How it works

This project uses collection variables to pass data between requests.

For example:

* I get all board IDs
* I store them in a variable
* I use one of them in the next requests

## 🔄 Project Structure and Workflow

### 📌 Main Functional Workflow

1️⃣ Create new board  
2️⃣ Update board  
3️⃣ Get board  

  ↳ 4️⃣ Create TODO list  
  ↳ 5️⃣ Create DONE list  
  ↳ 6️⃣ Update list  
  ↳ 7️⃣ Get lists  

    ↳ 8️⃣ Create new card  
    ↳ 9️⃣ Move card (TODO → DONE)  

      ↳ 🔟 Delete card  
      ↳ 1️⃣1️⃣ Get deleted card  

  ↳ 1️⃣2️⃣ Delete list  
  ↳ 1️⃣3️⃣ Get deleted list  

1️⃣4️⃣ Delete board  
1️⃣5️⃣ Get deleted board

### ⚠️ Important Dependency Note

- Lists must be created under an existing board  
- Cards must exist within a list  
- Deleting a board removes all associated lists and cards
---

### Maintenance

### Invalid Cases

---

## 🧪 Testing

I added tests in Postman to check:

* Status code (200 OK)
* If the correct data is returned
* If lists and cards belong to the correct board

---

## 🔄 Dynamic Data

I used collection variables such as:

* `lastBoardId`
* `boardsIds`
* `lastListId`

I also worked with arrays to handle multiple boards and updated variables after each request.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* API keys are not included
* Placeholder values are used (example: `INVALID_KEY`)

---

## ▶️ How to run

1. Import the Postman collection
2. Add your Trello API key and token
3. Run the collection

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add more negative tests
* Use environment variables
* Run tests using Newman
